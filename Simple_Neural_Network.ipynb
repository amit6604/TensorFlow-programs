As with all supervised learning methods, we have some (input, output) pairs which we denote as (xi,yi) and we have n of these, so i∈[1...n]. We want to learn a function f:x→y that maps inputs to outputs.\n",

        "Today, we're going to look at classifying digits. The inputs will be a 28 x 28 black and white image, and the output will be a 10 dimensional vector that represents the probabilities for each of the 10 digits. From these probabilities, you can then choose the probability with the highest value to produce a single value that best representing the number in the image. \n",
